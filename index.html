<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello there,<br> My name is Kwinten Olaerts.
I am a junior webdeveloper at BeCode.<br> I am working hard to get myself to the next level of programming.<br>
I love creating stuff, from websites to my own music and everything in between.<br>
I excel in practical thinking and have a big drive to make my mark in the world.<br>
Before I was a programmer I've had many different jobs and interests.<br>
I've been an educator, working with children from troubled backgrounds.<br>
There even was a time that I was a professional poker player.<br>
I like a challenge, but it has to be one with a goal attached.<br>
I love trying to win, but I've learned that there are things in this world that are more important than that.<br>
Please don't hesitate to contact me, I am open minded towards different people and projects.<br>
</p>
